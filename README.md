This project showcases a web application that combines the strengths of Streamlit for a user-friendly interface and LangChain for powerful LLM (Large Language Model) interactions with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. It allows users to easily provide prompts and receive tailored generative text responses.

What You'll Find:

Frontend: A clean and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit, offering input fields, buttons, and other UI elements for user interaction.
Backend: A LangChain application connected to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, handling prompt processing, LLM execution, and result retrieval.
Flexibility: Potential for customization to different applications and prompt types.
Collaboration: Ability to share the app easily with others.
